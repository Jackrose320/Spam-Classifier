# Spam Classifier

Using a [Naive Bayes Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) and trained data, it is possible to classify series' of Strings into being "spam" or "ham", based on *kitchen-sink* patterns IE that words that were previously spam can be identified as spam-centric again.
